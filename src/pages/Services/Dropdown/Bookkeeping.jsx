        As a dentist, you do not have the bandwidth to keep up with accounting on a daily basis. You probably are using QuickBooks or accounting software that captures your transactions. You are following a cash-based accounting model that will not truly reflect the value of the practice when you plan to sell your practice as it does not account for future cash flows. We will help you move to accrual-based accounting and keep your records straight.
